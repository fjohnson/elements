# Elements
 A chemical element discovery timeline visualizer.
 
This project uses Knight Lab's [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/index.html) to build a timeline of the discovery of the chemical elements. Information is dynamically taken from Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikicommons to build the visualization.

Try it out here using the following example timelines:

[The Lanthanides](https://fjohnson.github.io/elements/elements.html?atomicnumbers=57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71)

[Radioactive elements](https://fjohnson.github.io/elements/elements.html?atomicnumbers=43,61,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118)

[The Alkali metals](https://fjohnson.github.io/elements/elements.html?atomicnumbers=3,11,19,37,55,87)

[The Alkaline earth metals](https://fjohnson.github.io/elements/elements.html?atomicnumbers=4,12,20,38,56,88)

[Elements with atomic numbers 1-20](https://fjohnson.github.io/elements/elements.html?atomicnumbers=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20)

Or try out your own with the url https://fjohnson.github.io/elements/elements.html?atomicnumbers= and by adding the atomic numbers you would like to see in your timeline. Thus, https://fjohnson.github.io/elements/elements.html?atomicnumbers=1,2,3,4,5 would give you a timeline composed of the elements with atomic numbers between 1-5.
